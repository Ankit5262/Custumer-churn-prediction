# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Logistic Regression.

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses. In this project, I analyzed customer behavior patterns and built a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Logistic Regression model building
- Model evaluation using Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

## Results
- Achieved ~81% accuracy using Logistic Regression
- Identified key churn factors such as Age, Geography, Balance, and Active Membership
